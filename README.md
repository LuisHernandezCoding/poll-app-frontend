# Project Name: Poll App (Frontend)

## Description
This is a simple poll app Frontend built with ReactJS. Its a simple frontend that consumes the Poll App API. It allows the users to check out polls.
It also uses apollo client to consume the GraphQL API from the backend (witch is filled with dummy data), and it also uses react router to navigate between pages.
The idea here is just to show data to the user, and not to allow the user to create, edit or delete anything.
